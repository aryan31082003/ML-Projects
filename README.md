These are some of Machine Learning projects I have worked on. 
One of the work on "Hybrid approach to detect Phishing Link" is successfully accepted in IEEE ICRITO.
Each repo contains .ipynb colab file along with saved model and dataset.
If the "model" becomes curropt..please rerun colab cells in order. It will be regenrated. 

In low light enhancement . model.txt and dataset.txt contains drive link for dataset and model since these cannot be uploaded to github due to their large size
